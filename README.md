# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Using the dataset, I will analyze and classify the chance of having a heart disease. In this Dataset, the presence/absence of cardio disease is considered as a target value, and other columns like Age, Glucose, Blood pressure, etc. are considered as dependent columns, based on this assumption we are going to perform Logistic Regression.
